# Project Details and Design Choices
Used an interface to implement handlers for each command along with an executeCommands. This allows implementation of User Story 6
along with the rest of the stories. I integrated the RegisterCommand command into the index.tsx file, which takes in the 
command to be run through the Mock command line and a function to execute when it is called in the command line. No other significant 
design changes were made, other than formatting mock CSV files as JSON Strings rather than as 2D arrays.

# Errors/Bugs
No known errors or bugs

# Tests
Wrote front end tests for every method, along with parameters tests for too few, too many, and valid inputs.
also tested on both verbose and brief modes. Checked the output with playwright, but did not write unit tests
because there were no methods to unit test 

# How to
No bugs to recreate. For running, cd into the mock directory, then run npm start. From there, run any commands
you'd like to test the functionality
